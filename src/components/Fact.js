            <h2>Climbing Facts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>One of the first recorded climbs was in 1492, by Antoine de Ville, when ascending Mount Inaccessible, Mont Aiguille, a 300-meter rock tower south of Grenoble, France. Under orders from his king. He applied the techniques for sieging castles to attain the summit. The first actual pure rock climb, however, was in 1869 by John Muir, who did an on-sight, free solo ascent of Cathedral Park in Tuolumne Meadows, Yosemite national park.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>The tallest artificial climbing wall is owned by the BaseCamp Climbing Gym out in Reno, Nevada, USA. The wall measures 51.56 m tall, offering a climbable surface of 49.85 m, offering a range of climbing grades from an IFSC-certified 15-meter speed climb, to a two ledge, full height, multi-pitch climb. The BaseCamp wall is actually attached to a multi-story car park on the other side, meaning itâ€™s not free standing.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>The hardest sport climb in the world is called Silence, in the Flatanger area of Norway. It has yet to receive a repeat, but Adam Ondra put a grade of 5.15d (9c) on the climb. This displaced the previously tied honour, which was split between Change, La Dura Dura, and Vasil Vasil which were graded at 5.15c (9b+).</li>
                <br/>
                <li>The most dangerous mountain is the formidable Annapurna, the 10th highest mountain measuring 8,091 m. It was first climbed by Maurice Herzog and Louis Lachenal, two Frenchman, but since then has claimed 69 lives out of only 261 attempted ascents, meaning for every three climbers that make it up and down, one will die.</li>
                <br/>
                <li>The tallest ice climbing wall is actually not that tall, measuring only 20 m and based in O2 World building in Seoul, Korea and built in 2005</li>
                <br/>
                <li>The world record for the fastest speed climb goes to Libor Hroza who broke the record during the 2014 IFSC Climbing World Cup in Arco.</li>
