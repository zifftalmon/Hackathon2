Hi Ziv! 

Let me just start by saying that I LOVE your climbing gear store and information page!
It's user-friendly, it contains valuable information and teaching material and it is aesthetically clean.

- A good filing system would be to have your main project folder as the backend (server.js, config, .env), 
and in the main folder to have a client folder containing all the frontend files.
OR, two seperate folders called "backend"/"server" and "frontend"/"client" in your main project folder.
Your choice.

- When I first ran the program it gave me "undefined" port number because you need your .env 
file in the same location as your server.js file is, and you didnt add "()" 
after the dotenv.config in the server.js file.

- You have a hackathon2 folder with no content because it has a hidden .git 
folder in it, you can delete that and the folder will disappear.

- I absolutely LOVED how you passed the components in instances inside the Navbar component. Great use of Routes.

- I'm sure if you had more time, you'd have added the handleclick function to add items to cart, 
and have the option displayed for other products as well.

Overall, your code is clean, readable and understandable. 
You integrated the frontend, the backend and the db beautifully. What we call a PERN stack (postgres, express, react, node)
I loved it. Very good work Ziv.
